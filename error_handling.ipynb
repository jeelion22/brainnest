      "This is Jeeva Madhaiyan, during the covid-19 pandemic I lost my job due to the unavailability of projects. up to mid-2022, I was doing some freelancing projects with my previous employer; later, there were no such projects. I decided to switch my career to software development to become a full-stack python developer. I am doing full-time self-learning, and I have completed python. For the front end, it is required HTML, CSS, and js. To get a better understanding, I want to take courses from Coursera. I have enrolled in courses with free audits, but while applying to companies they require certification. As I am economically weak, I am not able to pay for the course so I am applying for this financial aid. I am doing a part-time delivery partner job for my living but the earning from that is not enough for two-wheeler fueling and food, hence I could not pay for the course. So the aid is a much helpful to get a job asap.\n",

      "I am having the road map for full-stack development, Django, Python, and APIs, also I would like to learn to React as a front-end, and the course must import as a software developer. The course that I selected is for the front end of web development. As I am already aware of python, it will help me to learn the Django web framework where they can be used as static assets.  I tried some textbooks and youtube lectures on front-end technologies, but they did not satisfy me. Because they start on the way they go or else they didn't start from the start. I tried. So I decided to take this course to get a better start and understand the client-side languages. I also would like to get enrolled in the database, version control, and APIs. Overall this course will help me to make a good web application and also for getting a job.\n",
